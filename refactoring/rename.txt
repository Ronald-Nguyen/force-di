Rename
Task Description
You are a strict code refactoring engine. You follow all rules exactly as written. Your task is to perform a refactoring change in an Apex project. A method needs to be renamed.
The renaming must be applied consistently across the entire project by updating every instance where it is used.

Please note:
1. The code must still function perfectly after the refactoring.
2. All imports, references, and method calls must be updated accordingly.
3. The style, formatting, and structure of the code must be preserved.
4. Do not introduce any new functionality, logic changes, or unrelated formatting changes.
5. For every modified file, return the complete updated file content to ensure that no changes are overlooked.
6. The semantics and behavior of the code must not change.
7. Only include files that required changes.
8. Respond with the code blocks only. Your entire response must be machine readable. Do not include any conversational filler.
9. If you are unsure, do not guess. Only modify code when the change is certain.
10. Every response must include meaningful modifications, improvements, or transformations. Returning the same code, even partially or with superficial edits, is strictly prohibited.
11. Your final output must pass the existing test suite. If your changes would cause any test to fail, revise your refactor until all tests pass.

Examples of renaming tasks:

Example 1:
Original Code:
File `CalculateSum.cls`:
```apex
public class CalculateSum {
    public static Integer calculateSum(Integer a, Integer b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void runExample() {
        System.debug(calculateSum(2, 3));
    }
}
```

Task:
1. Rename the method `calculateSum` in the file: `CalculateSum.cls` to `add`.
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. Output format (for EACH modified file):

File `CalculateSum.cls`:
```apex
public class CalculateSum {
    public static Integer add(Integer a, Integer b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void runExample() {
        System.debug(add(2, 3));
    }
}
```

Example 2:
Original Code:
File `FindMaximum.cls`:
```apex
public class FindMaximum {
    public static Integer findMaximum(List<Integer> numbers) {
        Integer maxVal = null;
        for (Integer n : numbers) {
            if (maxVal == null || n > maxVal) {
                maxVal = n;
            }
        }
        return maxVal;
    }

    public static void runExample() {
        Integer result = findMaximum(new List<Integer>{1, 2, 3});
        System.debug(result);
    }
}
```

Task:
1. Rename the method `findMaximum` in the file: `FindMaximum.cls` to `getMax`.
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. Output format (for EACH modified file):

File `FindMaximum.cls`:
```apex
public class FindMaximum {
    public static Integer getMax(List<Integer> numbers) {
        Integer maxVal = null;
        for (Integer n : numbers) {
            if (maxVal == null || n > maxVal) {
                maxVal = n;
            }
        }
        return maxVal;
    }

    public static void runExample() {
        Integer result = getMax(new List<Integer>{1, 2, 3});
        System.debug(result);
    }
}
```

Your Task:
1. Rename the method `hasSpec` in the file: `Hooks.cls` to `hasSpecification`
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.
3. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:

File `Filename.cls`:
```apex
[Complete updated file content]
```
