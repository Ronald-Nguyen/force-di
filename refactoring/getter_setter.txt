Getter_Setter
Task Description
You are a strict code refactoring engine. You follow all rules exactly as written. Your task is to perform a refactoring change for an Apex project. Specific class attributes must be encapsulated by replacing direct access with Getter and Setter methods (properties).

Please note:
1. The code must still function perfectly after the refactoring.
2. All imports, references, and method calls must be updated accordingly.
3. The style, formatting, and structure of the code must be preserved.
4. Do not introduce any new functionality, logic changes, or unrelated formatting changes.
5. For every modified file, return the complete updated file content to ensure that no changes are overlooked.
6. The semantics and behavior of the code must not change.
7. Only include files that required changes.
8. Respond with the code blocks only. Your entire response must be machine readable. Do not include any conversational filler.
9. If you are unsure, do not guess. Only modify code when the change is certain.
10. Every response must include meaningful modifications, improvements, or transformations. Returning the same code, even partially or with superficial edits, is strictly prohibited.
11. Your final output must pass the existing test suite. If your changes would cause any test to fail, revise your refactor until all tests pass.

Examples of Getter Setter tasks:

Example 1:
Original Code:
File `Person.cls`:
```apex
public class Person {
    public String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

Person person = new Person('Alice');
System.debug(person.name);
person.name = 'Bob';
```

Task:
1. Encapsulate the attribute `name` within the class `Person` in the file Person.cls.
2. Replace all direct attribute accesses with Apex properties using private backing fields and public getter/setter methods.
3. Update all references both inside the class and from external calls.
4. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:

File `Person.cls`:
```apex
public class Person {
    private String _name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this._name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return _name;
    }

    public void setName(String value) {
        _name = value;
    }
}

Person person = new Person('Alice');
System.debug(person.getName());
person.setName('Bob');
```

Example 2:
Original Code:
File `BankAccount.cls`:
```apex
public class BankAccount {
    public Decimal balance;

    public BankAccount(Decimal balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void withdraw(Decimal amount) {
        this.balance -= amount;
    }
}

BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);
account.balance = 500;
```

Task:
1. Encapsulate the attribute `balance` within the class `BankAccount` in the file BankAccount.cls.
2. Replace all direct attribute accesses with getter and setter methods.
3. Update all references both inside the class and from external calls.
4. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:

File `BankAccount.cls`:
```apex
public class BankAccount {
    private Decimal _balance;

    public BankAccount(Decimal balance) {
        this._balance = balance;
    }

    public Decimal getBalance() {
        return _balance;
    }

    public void setBalance(Decimal value) {
        _balance = value;
    }

    public void withdraw(Decimal amount) {
        this._balance -= amount;
    }
}

BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);
account.setBalance(500);
```

Your Task:
1. Encapsulate the attributes `BindingNameValue`, `BindingIdValue`, and `ParametersValu` within the class `di_InjectorComponentController` in the file `di_InjectorComponentController.cls`.
2. Replace all direct attribute accesses with getter and setter methods.
3. Update all references both inside the class and from external calls.
4. For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:

File `Filename.cls`:
```apex
[Complete updated file content]
```
